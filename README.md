Some initial experiments with Minecraft modding

This personal experimental mod is based on [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html) v.1.8.9 and on [https://github.com/Zyin055/zyinhud].


Presently it displays an FPS counter and the Player's x,y,z and direction.
